**Debugging in Java**

**Definition of Debugging**
- **Debugging**: The process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program that prevent correct operation .

**Importance of Debugging**
- Every developer should know debugging as it helps identify and fix bugs .
- Debugging is essential for understanding application execution flow, especially for new developers .

**Differences Between Debugging and Testing**
- **Testing**: The main purpose is to find a bug.
- **Debugging**: Focuses on finding the root cause of the bug and fixing it. Debugging is a deeper process than testing .

**Debugging Process**
1. **Choosing the Program**: Select the method you want to debug.
2. **Setting Breakpoints**: Choose a breakpoint from which to start debugging .
3. **Running in Debug Mode**: Launch the program in debug mode and confirm the perspective switch .

**Keyboard Shortcuts for Debugging**
- **F5**: Step into the method.
- **F6**: Step over to the next line.
- **F7**: Step out of the method.
- **F8**: Resume execution to the next breakpoint .

**Debugging a Standalone Application**
- Example: A calculator application with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division .
- Set breakpoints in the main class and debug to understand the execution flow .

**Debugging a Web Application**
- Start debugging by right-clicking the application and selecting "Debug as Debug on Server" .
- Example: Adding a book to a database and verifying its insertion .

**Remote Debugging**
- Allows debugging of applications running on different systems. Requires specifying the machine and port number .

**Conclusion**
- Debugging is a critical skill for developers, enabling them to identify and resolve issues effectively, understand application flow, and improve code quality.
