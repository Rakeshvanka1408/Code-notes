***NORMALIZATION***
>>The processes of reducing large tables into small,small tables is known as normalization.
		**TYPES OF NORMALIZATION**
		>>first normal form(1NF)
		>>second normalform(2nf)
		>>third normalform(3nf)
		>>boyce_codd normal form(bcnf)
NOTE POINT:-
            * if any table reduce to 3nf we can say table is normalized
 ###1NF###
 >>No repeated record duplicate 
 >>data entered in a cell must be single value
 >> we have make a large table by bringing all the attributes in a single table and
    make as large table.
###2NF###
 >>To become a second normal form table should follow first normalform rules
 >>Table should not have partial functional dependency .
 ###3NF###
 >> To become a 3nf the table should follow second normal form.
 >> We have to identify all the partial functional dependency to move such columns into a 
	separate table
