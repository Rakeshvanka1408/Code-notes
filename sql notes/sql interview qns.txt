1.what is Database?
	>> A database is an organized collection of data, stored and retrieved digitally from a 
	remote or local computer system
2.what is sql?
	>> sql stands for structured query language .it is the standard language for relational
	database management system. if is especially useful in handling organized data comprised of 
	entities(variables) and relations between different entities of the data.
3.what is difference between sql and mysql?
	SQL is a standard language for retrieving and manipulating structured databases. On the contrary, 
	MySql is relaional databasemanagement system, like sql server, oracle or IBM DB2,that is used
	to manage sql databases.
4.what is DBMS ?
	DBMS stands for database management System. DBMS is a system software responsible for the creation,
	retrieval, updation, and management of the database.
5.what is RDBMS? How is it different from DBMS?
	RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. THe key difference here, compared to DBMS,
	Is the that RDBMS stores data in the form of a collection of tables, and relations can be defined 
	between the common fields of these tables.
6.what are tables and fields?
	A table is an organized collection of data stored in the form of rows and columns, Columns can be
	categorized as vertical and rows as horizontal. the columns in a table are called fields while the
	rows can be reffered to as records.
	EXAMPLE: STUDENT DETAILS.
	FIELD: ID, DEPARTMENT , EMAIL.
	RECORDS:1, AJAY,AJAY@GMAIL.COM.
7. What are Constraints in SQL?
	Constraints are used to specify the rules concerning data in the table. It can be applied for single or multiple
	fields in an SQL table during the creation of the table of after creating using the ALTER TBALE COMMAND. The constraints are:
	NOT NULL    - Restricts NULL value from being inserted into a column.
	CHECK       - Verifies that all values in a field satisfy a condition.
	DEFAULT     - Automatically assigns a default value if no value has been specified for the field.
	UNIQUE		- Ensures unique value to be inserted into the field.
	INDEX		- Indexes a field providing faster retireval of records.
	PRIMARY KEY - uniquelu identifies each record in a table.
	FOREIGN KEY - ensure referential integrity for a record in another table.
8. what is a PRIMARY key?
	The PRIMARY KEY constraints uniquely identifies each row in a table. it must contain unique value
	and has an implicit NOT NULL constraint.
9. what is a UNIQUE constraint?
	A UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different. This provides uniqueness
	for the column(s) and helps  identify each row uniquely. Unlike primary key, there can be 
	multiple unique constraints defined per table.
10. what is foreign key?
	 A FOREIGN KEY comprises of single or collection of fields in a table tat essentially refers to
	 the  PRIMARY KEY  in anothe table. FOREIGN key constraint establishes the relation between two tables.
11. what are the different subsets of SQL? 
	DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE(DDL)- It allows you to perform various operations on the database such as
	CREATE, ALTER, AND DELETE objects.
	DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE (DML)- IT allows you to access and manipulate data. it helps you to insert,
	update, delete and retrieve data from the database.
	DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE(DCL) - It allows you to control acess to the database. Example-Grant, Revoke access permissions.
	TRANSACTION CONTROL LANGUAGE (TCL) - It is used to deal with the transacton operations in the database. 
	The commands in the category are COMMIT, TOLLBACK, SET TRANSACTION, SAVEPOINT,etc,.
12. what are the set operators in sql?
	we use the set operators to merge data from one or more tables of the same  kind. Although the set operators are like
	SQL joins, there is a significant distinction,
	1.UNION: It combines two or more results from multiple select queries into a single result set, it has a default features
	to remove the duplicate rows from the tables. The following syntax illustrates the Union operator.
13. what are sql comments?
	Comments are explanations or annotations in SQL queries that are readable by programmers. It's
	used to make sql statements easier to understand for humans. During the parsing of SQL code, it
	will be ignored , comments can be written on a single line or across several lines.
	>>SINGLE LINE COMMENTS; it starts with two consecutive hyphens(--).
	>>MULTI-LINE comments: it starts with /* and ends with */
14.How to drop view?
	DROP VIEW VIEW_NAME;
	
	
	
	
	
	VIEW SYNTAX;
		CREATE VIEW VIEW_NAME AS SELECT COULUMN_NAME(S) FROM TABLE_NAME;
		EX: CREATE VIEW DEMO AS SELECT ENAME,SAL,EMPNP FROM EMP;
