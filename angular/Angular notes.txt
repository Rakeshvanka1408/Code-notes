Angular Introduction
------------------------
->Angular is a client side frameword
->Angular is used to create Web Applications
->Angular is mainly used for Single Page Applications Development.
->Angular supports all platforms(Desktop and Mobile).
->Angular is free and open source.
->Angular is having cross-browser compatibility.
->Angular is developed by google.
---------------------------------------------------

Angular JS and Angular Framework
======= ========= ========= ====
->The initial version of Angular is Angular Js(Angular 1.0)which is developed by using Java Script.
->After few days google realized the problems with Angular JS then they started developing 
  one new framework to develop wev applications thats where Angular Framework came into Market.
  This Angular framework is developed by using Type Script
-> From Version 2.0 onwards it is called as Angular Framework
->Angular 2.0 is not enhancement for Angular 1.0 because in 2.0 version Google 
  Developers completely re-written Angular framework by using TypeScript.
-> Typescript developed by Microsoft Company.
-> Angular 2+ versions are extensions of Angular 2.0 version
-> Angular 1.x versions are called as Angular JS
-> Angular 2.0 and later versions are called as Angular framework versions
-> The current version of Angular is ..(Latest version released in nov-202_).
-------------------------------------------------------
Angular Architecture
===== ===== =======
1.Components
2.Meta Data
3.Services 
4.Templates
5.Directives
6.Pipes

Angular -11
--------------------
-> Angular is a client side framework
-> Angular is used to create web applications
-> Angular is mainly used to develop single page application
	ex; gmail, angular.io
-> Angular frmework is free and open source
-> Angular framework developed by Google
-> There are 2 flavours of Angular
			1.Angular JS (Angular 1.x)
			2.Angular (Angular 2+ versions)
-> Angular js is developed using java script 
-> Angular framework is developed by using TypeScript
note: Angular framework is completely re-written by google  in Angular 2.0 version
-> Angular is not extension for Angular js (angular is completely different from angular js)


Angular Architecture
---------------------------
1.Components
		-Component is a typescript class  which acts as Request Handler
2.Meta Data
		-Meta Data describes  Component and Template mapping
3.Service
		-Service is a TypeScript class which is used to write business logics
4.Data Bindings
		-Data  Bindings are used for transferrng the data from component to template and from template to component.
5.Template
		-Template is a HTML file which contains presentation logic
6.Directives
		-Directives are used for DOM	 Manipulation
7.Pipes
		-Pipes are use to transforming the data from one format to another format.


TypeScript:
-----------------
-> TypeScript is a programming language which is developed by using Java Script .

-> TypeScript is superset of java script which adds data types + classes + Interfaces etc..

-> typescript can be used for both client side and server side programming

-> TypeScript develped  by Microsoft company in 2012.

Features of TypeScript
---------------------------
->TypeScript is general purpose programming language 
 
-> TypeScript buit on top of java script

->TypeScript supports all features of java script and it is providing some addiitional features

note: Java Script can be executed in browser directley where as Browser can't execute Typescript Directly

->TypeScript files should be converted into java script

-> The process of convertion TypeScript file into javascritp is called as "Transpilation".
				files.ts ---------> tsc----------> file.js----------->browser---------->output

->typescript provided compiler (tsc) it is used to perform "Transpilation".
->Supports for OOps also.
				
TypeScript versions:
------------------------
TypeScript o.8  : 2012 (initial version)
............
TypeScript 5.x : 2024

Static Typing & Dynamic Typing
--------------------------------------
-> Whenever we can fix a data  type for the variable while declaration of the variable and we can't change its datatype througout the program then it is called as "Static Typing"

						int age = 20;//valid
						age = "20 years" ;//in-valid
			ex: c,c++,java,c#, .Net are examples for static typing language
		
-> If we can't fix data type for the variable while declaration and the data type will be automatically taken by the runtime engine at the time of program execution then it is called as "Dynamic Typing"

							var age;
							age = 20;//valid
							age = "20 years" ;//valid
		ex: JavaScript and python  are examples for Dynamic Typing Language
	
->TypeScript supports "optional Static typing". It supports both Static Typing and Dynamic Typing

->TypeScript maintains Type Safety . If we specify data type while declaring the variable and if we 
	assign wrong type of value into variable then compiler shows error.
	
TypeScript Installation
-----------------------------
->Install node JS (nodejs.org)
->in cmd promp -> npm install -g typescript
->tsc -v ; to find typescript version installed 

TypeScript First Example
-----------------------------
->Create TypeScript file with .ts exxtension and add below code 
										
										var s:string ="Hello World";//in java: String s  ="Hello World";
										console.log(s);// in java :System.out.println(s);
->Open cmd and compile typescript file
		
										tsc<filename>.ts
		note: tsc compiler will convert ts file into js file (Transpilation)
->Run js file using node with below command
					node <filename>.js


variables in TypeScript
----------------------------
-> Variables are used to store the value
->variable is a named memory (every variable will have name and will occupy some memory)

										Syntax: var variableName: dataType = value;
										
										ex:     var age: int = 20;// variable in typescript
										           int age = 20; // in java
												  
DataTypes
--------------
->DataTypes specifies what type of value that can be stored into variable.

Typescript datatypes
------------------------
->number
->string
->boolean
->any: Any type of value we can store

		var pname :string = "rakesh";//valid
		var age: number = 24;
		var gender : string = 'male';//valid
