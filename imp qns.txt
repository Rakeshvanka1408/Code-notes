1.what will you do if a sudden error occured in the software?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>open ELK(Elastic search + Logstash + Kibana) 
>>open log file(log files are created by the computer which stores the information about the activities,operation,usage of the system)
>>select the particular time when the error occured and downlod the log file and read it, so that you can find the root cause of the error
	
2) What is difference between Interface and Abstract?
---------------------------------------------------------
=>Abstract Class:
			An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be extended by other classes.
=>Interface:
An interface is a blueprint for a class that defines a set of methods that a class must implement.

3) Why Constructors cannot be Static?
--------------------------------------
=> Constructors cannot be static because they are designed to initialize objects, 
which inherently require an instance context. Static methods and variables belong
 to the class, not instances, making them incompatible with the purpose of a constructor.
 
4) What is the super class of exception?
------------------------------------------
	java.lang.Object
    |
    +-- java.lang.Throwable
            |
            +-- java.lang.Error
            |       +-- OutOfMemoryError
            |       +-- StackOverflowError
            |
            +-- java.lang.Exception
                    +-- IOException
                    +-- SQLException
                    +-- RuntimeException
                            +-- NullPointerException
                            +-- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
                            +-- ArithmeticException
		
1. Throwable:
		The Throwable class is the root class for all errors and exceptions in Java.
		It has two direct subclasses:
		1.Error
		2.Exception
2. Error:
		Represents serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch.
		Examples:
				OutOfMemoryError
				StackOverflowError
				VirtualMachineError
3. Exception
Represents conditions that a program might want to catch and handle.
The Exception class has two categories:
	Checked Exceptions: Must be declared in the throws clause of a method or caught using a try-catch block.
			Examples:
			IOException
			SQLException
			FileNotFoundException
	Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions): Do not need to be declared or caught.
			Examples:
			NullPointerException
			ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
			ArithmeticException
			
5) Super class of AbstractList?
--------------------------------
	The superclass of the AbstractList class in Java is AbstractCollection, which is part of the java.util package. 
>>Common Subclasses of AbstractList
	ArrayList<E>
	LinkedList<E>
	Vector<E>
	CopyOnWriteArrayList<E> (in java.util.concurrent)
