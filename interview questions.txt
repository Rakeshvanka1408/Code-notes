1) why did you choose this field?
---------------------------------------
"I chose software development because I love the creative process of building applications
 that can solve real-world problems and have a direct impact on users." 
 
 2) where do you see yourself in next 5 years?
 -----------------------------------------------------
 "In the next five years, I see myself growing as a skilled software developer, taking on more responsibilities,
 and contributing to challenging projects. I'd also like to mentor junior developers and expand my leadership skills 
 while continuing to learn and stay up-to-date with new technologies. Ultimately, I want to make a meaningful 
 impact on the team and the company.
 
 3)Why should we hire you?
 --------------------------------
 "I believe my strong foundation in Core and Advanced Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, combined with my passion
 for coding, would allow me to contribute effectively to your team. I am also highly adaptable, eager to learn 
 new technologies, and always looking for ways to improve my problem-solving skills. Beyond technical abilities,
 I bring a collaborative mindset and a strong work ethic, ensuring that I can work well within your team
 and align with the company’s goals. I’m excited about the opportunity to grow with your company and contribute to its success."
 
 4) How do you handle Stress and pressure?
 ----------------------------------------------------
 "As a fresher, I understand that stress and pressure are part of any professional environment. 
 When faced with tight deadlines or challenging situations, I prioritize my tasks and break down larger 
 challenges into smaller, achievable goals to make progress step by step. I also make sure to communicate 
 openly with my team if additional support is needed. I also believe in taking short breaks when necessary
 to refresh my mind and maintain productivity. I stay calm under pressure, 
 and I try to keep a positive attitude, as I know it's important to learn and grow from these experiences.""
 
 5)How do yu describe your leadership skills?
 -------------------------------------------------------
 "While I haven’t had a formal leadership role yet, I believe leadership is about guiding and motivating others 
 toward a common goal. I demonstrate leadership through my ability to collaborate well with team members, 
 listen to different perspectives, and offer support when needed. I also take the initiative to contribute ideas and 
 help my peers when I can. I’m always eager to learn and improve, and I look forward to growing my leadership 
 skills through experience, feedback, and opportunities in the workplace."
 
 6) Can you provide an example of  a situation where have you demostrated strong leadership skills?
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 " I have had opportunities to demonstrate leadership skills in academic projects. During a group project in my final year, 
 we had to develop a software solution within a tight deadline.I took the initiative to organize tasks based on each team 
 member's strengths and set a clear timeline. I ensured open communication, addressed concerns, and kept everyone motivated.
 The project was completed on time, and this experience helped me understand the importance of organization, teamwork, 
 and leadership."
 
 7) Least subject u like. Why it is least?
 8) why java and why not any other languages?
**"I chose Java because it strikes a balance between simplicity and power. It’s platform-independent,
 which means 'write once, run anywhere,' making it highly versatile for developing applications 
 across different systems. The language’s robust libraries and frameworks enable efficient coding 
 for complex tasks, especially in enterprise-level applications.
Additionally, Java has a strong focus on object-oriented programming, which aligns with my way of 
structuring problems and solutions. The community support and extensive documentation also make it
 easier to learn, troubleshoot, and grow as a developer.
While I respect other languages for their unique strengths—like Python for data science or JavaScript
 for web development—Java’s reliability, scalability, and widespread use in industries make it my 
 preferred choice for building stable and efficient software solutions."**


 9) One successful story?
    My father’s success story is one of resilience and unwavering dedication. Coming from a background 
 where education was a distant dream, he had to start working at a very young age to support his
 family. He eventually found work as a security guard—a humble and physically demanding job.
    Despite the long hours and modest income, my father never let his lack of formal education hold
 him back. He was determined to give his children the opportunities he never had. Every rupee he
 earned went toward ensuring we had a roof over our heads, food on the table, and access to education.
 
    I remember how he would come home tired after long shifts, yet he always had a smile for us and would
 ask about our studies. He often said, 'My biggest dream is to see you succeed and lead a life better
 than mine.' His sacrifices taught me the value of hard work, humility, and perseverance.

	Today, as I stand on the path of success, I owe it all to him. Though he may not have earned 
	degrees or accolades, my father is my hero—a man who showed me that true success is about making 
	a difference in the lives of those you love. His story is a constant reminder that education, 
	though important, is not the only measure of a person’s worth or potential."**
 10) One unsuccessful story?
 11) About native place?
 12) About weakness?
 13)problems and conflicts?
 14) which one do you prefer Work From Home or work from Office? and why?
 15)  If we Won't Hire you what Would you Do.
 16) What is Trending Technology Now Booming. And why didn't you choose that technology instead of java
 17) Othet than Technical have you Participated in Any Events.
 18)  Why do Want to Shift To IT from non-It.
 19) How to OverCome From Challenges.
 20)  Why your Team Members have Choosen  you for the Project? 
 21) Apart from Technical Side what. did u Learn from ur Project
 22) What do you learn from your project?
