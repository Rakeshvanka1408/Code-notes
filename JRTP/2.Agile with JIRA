Agile with JIRA
=================

SDLC : Software development lifecycle

=> SDLC Represents software project development process from starting to ending.

=> We have several phases in SDLC 

	1) Requirements Gathering
	
	2) Analysis
	
	3) Design
	
	4) Development
	
	5) Testing
	
	6) Deployment
	
	7) Support (SLA)
	
=================
Waterfall Model	
=================

=> It is the first SDLC methodology came into market.

=> It is linear model / sequential model.

=> In waterfall model after one step completed then only we will move to next step.

Note: It supports only forward direction.

=> Requirements + Budget + Duration is fixed.

Note: We can't change project requirements in middle.

=> CLient involvement is very less here and client will get the chance to see the project at the end.

Note: If we want to develop large scale applications then waterfall model is not recommended.
example for disadvantage:
>>You are developing a project and it will be released into the market in next 3months, but some 
	other company released the project with same idea.

============
Agile Model
============

=> It is an iterative approach to develop and deliver applications to client.

=> In agile model "planning + development + testing + deployment" is a continous process.

=> Project will be delivered to client in multiple releases (sprints).

=> Client involvement is very high and client feedback is very very important.

Note: Requirements + Budget + Duration  not fixed in agile model.

============
Agile Team
============

1) Product Owner
2) Project Manager
3) Scrum Master
4) Tech Lead
5) Team members


=> Product Owner is responsible for client deliverables.

=> Project Manager is responsible to manage the work in the project.

=> Scrum Master is responsible for team colloborations. 

=> Scrum Master is responsible to take daily work updates from team members.

=> Tech Lead is a senior resource in the project and tech lead is responsible to solve technical challenges in the project.

=> Team members means "developers + testers".



==================
Agile Terminology
==================

1) Backlog Grooming

2) Story(task that we have to do)

3) Story Points

4) Sprint Planning

5) Sprint

6) Scrum

7) Retrospective


=> Backlog Grooming is a meeting that is used to discuss about pending works in the project.

=> For every pending work we will create a story in JIRA.

=> Story points will represent duration to complete that story.

		1 day time ===> 3 points
		
		2 days time ===> 6 points
		
		3 days time ==> 9 points
		
Note: Every team member will have access to JIRA to create stories in backlog.	

=> Sprint Planning is the process of identifying priotity stories to deliver from backlog stories.	

=> Sprint means set of stories we need to develop + test + deliver in 2 weeks of time.

Note: As per standard, sprint duration is 2 weeks (we can change it also as per our requirements).

=> Scrum is a daily meeting in which scrum master will take team work updates.

=> Retrospective meeting is used to discuss about sprints feedback.

		- what went well
		- what went wrong
		- lessons learnt
		- new ideas

JIRA	
=======

=> Project management software 

=> We can use this as bug reporting  software also

=> JIRA developed by Atlasian company

=> JIRA is a commerical software, we can use trial version for practice.
